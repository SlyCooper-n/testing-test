## :pushpin: About

This project was created to practise some new concepts that I've been studying, like testing... Personaly I didn't think about working on this project so much in terms of style, but when I was finishing the tests I thought it would be interesting to put some nice stuff in there.

There are two folders:
- `web/`, which contains the website
- ~~`server/`, which contains the server~~ (it was replaced by Next.js API routes)
